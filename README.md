# Triangle Net to Pyramid

A problem was proposed and answer mistakenly formulated, so I decided to animate my solution.

## The Problem

Let there be a triangle whose vertices are at ``(0, 0)``, ``(68, 0)``, and ``(32, 48)``. Consider a medial triangle whose vertices are the midpoints of the original triangles sides. A triangular pyramid is formed by folding the original triangle along the sides of the medial triangle. What is the pyramid's volume?
